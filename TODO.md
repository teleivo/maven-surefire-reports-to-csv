# TODO

* -dest should expect and create a directory when -concat is false, a file when
  -concat is true. -concat=true -dest ./foo/faa.csv should it also create foo?
  its definitely convenient
* look at schema to only parse maven surefire reports and not any xml file
* print summary of how many where converted?
* rename archives to `sure_...` or the entire repo?
